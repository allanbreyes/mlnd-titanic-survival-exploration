# Titanic Survival Exploration

### Question 1
Performance of the naive predictor

The predictions_0 function has been run and the accuracy of the predictions is reported.

predictions_0 should have a prediction accuracy of 61.62%.

### Question 2
Performance of the simple predictor

The predictions_1 function has been correctly implemented.
The expected accuracy of the predictions is reported.

predictions_1 should have a prediction accuracy of 78.68%.

### Question 3
Performance of the intermediate predictor

The predictions_2 function has been correctly implemented.
The expected accuracy of the predictions is reported.

predictions_2 should have a prediction accuracy of 79.35%.

### Question 4
Creating a complex predictor

The predictions_3 function has been correctly implemented and obtains a prediction accuracy of at least 80%. The approach to the task has been documented, including features that were explored and intermediate steps taken to complete the function.

As a suggestion, students should investigate Pclass, Parch and SibSp more closely (split on Sex) if they cannot reach the 80% threshold.

### Question 5
A scenario for performing supervised learning

A valid scenario where supervised learning can be applied is reported. A clear outcome variable and at least two potential predictor variables are identified as part of the description.

Make sure the student's suggestion is not an unsupervised learning task!
